				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bull Terrier is known as the "three-year-old child in a dog suit." These dogs are active, happy, clownish, and extremely attached to their owners and family. They love people unconditionally, and are friendly, sweet, and fun-loving. They are cuddly, and will try to curl up in your lap, even though they don't really fit. When you cuddle them, they have a sort of snort-purr that Bull Terrier parents find irresistible. While they are incredibly charming, they are also stubborn and conniving. They certainly think for themselves. You will need to obedience train your Bull Terrier, because they are a strong dog, both physically and mentally, and you do not want to end up wrestling your Bull Terrier for control.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very high energy and highly active and they need lots and lots (and lots) of exercise. A bored Bull Terrier will search, chew, and destroy. They can chew through a bulletproof vest. The Bull Terrier can be difficult to housetrain. They love children, but their rough and tumble style of play can easily flatten a young child. They like to join in the family fun and are tireless playmates, chasing balls for hours. They seem to thrive on your laughter and they will certainly get you chuckling with their antics. When they walk under something that tickles their back, such as a tablecloth, or a bush, their eyes will glaze over and they will slow their walk down, and look like they are sleepwalking.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also practice something called "hucklebutting." The dog will take off at full speed and sprint all over the house, through table legs, around corners, as fast as they possibly can. Sometimes they run into walls, but this doesn't slow them down. They will also play chicken and run right at you as fast as they can, swerving to miss you at the last second. If you lose your nerve and step to the side, you could be seriously injured! They can do well with other animals, but are often aggressive toward same-sex dogs.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have a prey instinct and often chase small animals. They can also be food aggressive. They make good watch dogs and have natural guard dog instincts. You will need to train a Bull Terrier to ensure that his natural instincts don't turn into aggression. So, if you like to laugh and are the easy-going type, you are sure to love the independent, energetic, challenging, and sometimes downright silly Bull Terrier. Just be aware that they act like a puppy, with a puppy's energy level, until they're about three years old. And if you put a coat on him in the wintertime, he will probably eat it.
