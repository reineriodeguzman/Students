					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bouvier Des Flandres is the ideal farm dog: calm, rational, and intelligent, with an independent nature. They also make devoted family companions. They will be a family friend and guardian. They are alert, resolute, and fearless. They are naturally territorial and protective and have a fantastic "No Trespassing" bark. Yet they do not become aggressive unless it is absolutely necessary. They are aloof toward strangers, but seem to have an innate sense of who is and who isn't a real threat. If they deem someone a threat, they will bark and/or growl. Because of their size and strength, and their assertive personalities, it is essential to start obedience training with this breed early. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herding. Just be aware that this breed is not blindly obedient, and can be a bit stubborn. The Bouvier needs a great deal of outdoor exercise. He will need at least a long daily walk. Bored and inactiveBouviers will chew, dig, bark, and destroy. They usually get along well with other pets, especially if they are raised together.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Bouviers however can be cat or dog aggressive. These are people dogs. They will want to follow you everywhere. Companionship is their top requirement. They are affectionate, but are not overly demonstrative. They are exceptionally good with children, and seem to have a natural empathy with them. They are emotionally sensitive dogs and seem to know when you are happy, angry or sad. Just beware that these are large dogs who might try to herd your children, especially during play. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they might try to herd anything, including bicycles, joggers, and cars. These are rugged, serene, sober, thoughtful, even-tempered dogs who make it their job to love their families. Just be aware: they have very stinky flatulence.
