					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bulldog, also known as the English Bulldog, is friendly, calm, gentle, and good-natured. He is a couch-potato! He loves to curl up on the couch and sleep all day. He's stubborn and unwavering. If he doesn't want to do something, you'll have a hard time getting him to do it! His clownish behavior will make you laugh. He forms a strong bond with children and is very good with them. He thrives on lots of attention and love from his family. He can be a verydestructive chewer so give him plenty of chew toys and hide your slippers.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's a homebody; he isn't the kind of dog to wander off and prefers to stay in the yard close to home. He drools and slobbers a lot -- especially after eating and drinking (expect mess). He often has wind (flatulence) and it can be quite smelly. He snores loudly and snuffles, snorts and grunts frequently. His flat face and short nose causes him to overheat in hot weather. If he does you will need to take him inside in the air conditioning or allow him to rest in the shade until he cools down.
