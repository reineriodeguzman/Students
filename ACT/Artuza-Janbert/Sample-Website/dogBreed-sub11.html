				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Dog of Wisconsin, the American Water Spaniel, was bred to be a companion as well as a retriever. This is an athletic, active, and energetic dog who loves his daily exercise. They need to be kept busy in order to work off some of their energy. 
					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Though they are great all-around hunting dogs, they also enjoy runs in the park, swimming, playing in the backyard, obedience training, and agility work. He needs to exercise his brain as well, as he boreseasily, and if gets bored, he can be destructive.
					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a very vocal dog and can be quite the little barker, but training can help with this. He is intelligent, eager to please, and responds well to obedience training. He is a happy, friendly, tenacious, outgoing dog who loves to be the center of attention.
