				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primarily used as a hunting dog, the Black and Tan Coonhound can also make a loving family pet. They are people-oriented, gentle and playful. They love to spend time with their families. They will expect to be allowed on the furniture and they love to go for rides in the car. Most are laid-back and good with children and other animals. However, most will also take any opportunity to chase small animals up a tree and then bark to let you know they've done so. Their bark is deep and booming -- Westminster Kennel Club calls it a "mournful bawl" -- and your neighbors might not appreciate it. 
					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they do not need to hunt to be happy, they do need moderate daily exercise on a leash or a fenced area. A fence is important, as the Black and Tan has an excellent nose and will follow his nose on a trail he finds exciting. He will tree the neighborhood cat. These are independent dogs who are slow to mature, so early obedience training is important. These are outgoing, friendly, happy-go-lucky dogs who adapt well to any situation in which they are loved. Just be careful with giving kisses, as many of them like to drool!
