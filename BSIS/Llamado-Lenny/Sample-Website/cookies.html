               <p> CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE </p>
                <p>INGREDIENTS </p>
               <p>  1 stick + 7 tablespoonsbutter - unsalted</p>
               <p>  1/2 cup brown sugar</p>
               <p>  12 ounce bag mini chocolate morsels</p>
                <p>  1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
                <p>  1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
               <p>  2 eggs</p>
                <p> 3/4 cup granulated sugar</p>
               <p>  1 teaspoon salt </p>
               <p>  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour </p>

               <p> Step 1 </p>
                Preheat your oven to 375º Fahrenheit. 

                Sift the flour into a medium-sized bowl. Add the baking soda and salt. Whisk together. Set this bowl aside for later.
                <p>Step 2</p>
                Add the softened butter, sugars, and vanilla into your empty stand mixer's bowl.
                <p>Step 3</p>

                Using the paddle attachment on your stand mixer, beat the butter and sugars together at medium speed. Do this until the mixture becomes light and fluffy.
               <p> Step 4</p>
                Add the eggs to the mixing bowl and beat until combined.
               <p> Step 5</p>
                With the stand mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture you set aside in step 1 into the mixing bowl in batches.

                <p>Step 6</p>
                Once most of the flour is no longer sitting on the top, you can increase the speed of your mixer. Stop once the flour has become fully incorporated. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed.
               <p> Step 7</p>
                Here is the cookie dough ready for chocolate chips or whatever additions you want to add in.
               <p> Step 8</p>
                Add the mini chocolate chips into the cookie dough and stir on low until evenly combined. Although you could use regular chocolate chips, morsels or even large pistoles, we found that the mini chocolate chips look the best in the cookie. Also, with the mini chocolate chips, every bite has just the perfect amount of chocolate. 

               <p> Step 9</p>
                Place a sheet of parchment paper down on a baking sheet. Use a teaspoon scoop to scoop the chocolate chip cookie dough onto the parchment paper. Space out the cookies so that they are about 2 inches apart. For a larger cookie, use a tablespoon measure and increase the distance between each cookie. 

                Bake the chocolate chip cookies at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes or until they have a nice golden color. Keep a close eye on them as oven temperatures can vary.

                                     <p> DOUBLE CHOCOLATE COOKIES </p>
               <p> INGREDIENTS:</p>
               <p>  1 and 1/2 sticks (20 tablespoons) butter - unsalted, softened</p>
              <p>  2 cups sugar</p>
               <p>  2 eggs</p>
               <p>  2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
                <p>  3/4 cup cocoa</p>
               <p>  1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
              <p>  2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
              <p>  1 teaspoon salt</p>
               <p>   1 and 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</p>
<br>
            <p>    Step 1
                Add the sugar and softened butter to a large mixing bowl.</p>
             <p>   Step 2
                Cream the butter and sugar together until smooth.

                Beat in the eggs and vanilla.</p>
             <p>   Step 3
                Add the flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda to a separate bowl.</p>
             <p>   Step 4
                Whisk together to combine.</p>
             <p>   Step 5
                Gradually add some of cocoa mixture to the butter mixture. Stir well. Repeat until all the cocoa mixture has been stirred in.</p>
             <p>   Step 6
                At this point you can mix in any additions you like. For this double chocolate cookie recipe we will be adding semisweet chocolate morsels.</p>
              <p>  Step 7
                Here is the finished double chocolate cookie dough.</p>
             <p>   Step 8
                lace parchment paper down on a baking sheet. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop up a ball of dough and place it on the parchment. Repeat, spacing the balls of cookie dough approximately 2 inches apart.</p>


              <p>  Step 9
                Bake the double chocolate cookies at 350º Fahrenheit for 8-10 minutes. 

                Place the cookies onto a wire rack to cool. Repeat these last two steps until all of the cookies has been baked. This recipe will make about 40 cookies when using a tablespoon scoop. </p>

                             <p>   OATMEAL COOKIES </p>

                    <p>INGREDIENTS: </p>
                    <p>  1/2 cup granulated sugar </p>
                   <p>  1 cup light brown sugar - packed </p>
                    <p>   1 cup raisins - dark </p>
                    <p>  3/4 cup (3.75 ounces) all-purpose flour </p>
                   <p>   3/4 cup (3.75 ounces) oat flour </p>
                    <p>  3 cups old-fashioned oats(I only had quick-cooking oats on hand). Old-fashioned oats will give a better flavor and texture) </p>
                    <p>  1/2 teaspoon salt </p>
                  <p>  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon </p>
                   <p>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract </p>
                   <p>  1/4 teaspoon nutmeg - freshly grated </p>
                    <p>  1/2 teaspoon baking powder </p>
                   <p>  2 eggs </p>
                    <p> 2 sticks unsalted butter - softened </p>
<br>
                   <p> Step 1
                    Place your oven racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat your oven to 350º Fahrenheit. Be sure to use an oven thermometer to insure your oven temp is correct. If not, adjust it accordingly.  

                    Add the flour, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and cinnamon to a medium-sized bowl. </p>
                    <p>Step 2
                    Whisk everything together. Set this bowl aside. </p>
                    <p>Step 3
                    In your stand mixer bowl, add the butter and sugars. </p>
                    <p>Step 4 
                    Beat the butter and sugars together at medium speed with your stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. This should take a couple of minutes. The butter should become light and fluffy. </p>
                    <p>Step 5
                    Add the eggs, and vanilla extract. </p>
                   <p> Step 6
                    Beat the eggs and vanilla extract together until combined. This should only take a half a minute or less. It's best to add the eggs one at a time and blend after each. </p>
                   <p> Step 7
                    With your stand mixer on low, add the dry mixture you set aside in step 2 until combined. You want to add the dry ingredients in two or three batches, letting the mixture incorporate each batch before adding the next. This should take a half a minute or so. </p>
                   <p> Step 8
                    Here is the cookie batter base ready for the oats and raisins. </p>
                   <p> Step 9
                    Add the raisins and oats to the cookie batter. </p>
                    <p>Step 10
                    With the stand mixer still on low, beat together the oats and raisins until they mix into the batter until just combined. Don't over mix as you don't want the cookies to become tough. </p>
                   <p> Step 11
                    Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a tablespoon scoop, scoop 2 tablespoons of the oatmeal raisin cookie dough into your hands and roll the dough into a ball. Place the ball of dough onto the parchment paper. You want to make all the dough balls this same size. You shouldn't need the tablespoon measure to help you any longer. You want to place each ball of dough to have about 2 inches of spacing. Each baking tray should hold 12 cookies.  </p>

                   <p> Place the baking sheets into the oven and cook your oatmeal raisin cookies at 350º Fahrenheit for 22-25 minutes, switching and rotating the pans at the halfway point to insure that the oatmeal raisin cookies cook evenly.  </p>

                   <p> You want to remove the cookies when they have a golden brown color around the edges. Since oven temperature can vary by a wide margin, keep an eye on them. Once removed from the oven, allow the oatmeal raisin cookies to cool on the trays for a couple minutes before moving them onto a plate.  </p>

                                <p> Peanut Butter Cup Cookies </p>

               <p> INGREDIENTS:  </p>
                <p>   1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour - sifted </p>
               <p>   1/2 teaspoon  </p>
               <p>  1 teaspoon baking soda </p>
                <p>  1/2 cup butter - softened </p>
               <p>   1/2 cup sugar - granulated </p>
               <p>   1/2 cup brown sugar - packed (pushed down in measuring cup) </p>
             <p>  1 egg - beaten </p>
             <p>  1/2 cup peanut butter - chunky (adds some crunch) </p>
             <p>  1 and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract </p>
               <p>  2 tablespoons milk </p>
             <p>  40 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - Miniatures - wrappers removed (Place your wrapped peanut butter cups into the freezer for 10 minutes before you unwrap them to prevent the chocolate from melting while you remove the wrappers.) </p>
<br>
               <p> Step 1
                Preheat your oven to 375º Fahrenheit. 

                <p>Place the unwrapped peanut butter cups into the freezer. This will allow them to harden up before you place them into the hot peanut butter cookies. 

               <p> Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt over a medium-sized bowl. This will help disperse the dry ingredients and break up any clumps.    </p>  
                <p>Step 2
                Use a fork or a whisk to evenly mix the ingredients together. </p>
               <p> Step 3
                Place the softened butter, sugars, and peanut butter into a large mixing bowl. </p>
                <p>Step 4
                If you have a stand mixer, attach the paddle attachment, and beat everything together until it is all creamed and fluffy. </p>
               <p> Step 5
                Add in the milk, vanilla, and egg. </p>
                <p>Step 6
                Continue beating until everything has become fully incorporated. </p>
               <p> Step 7
                Add the flour in a few batches, mixing well between each addition. </p>
                <p> Step 8
                Here is a picture of the finished peanut butter cookie dough. </p>
                <p>Step 9
                Use a tablespoon measure to scoop up some of the dough. Roll the dough between your palms to make a ball. (If you find that the dough is too sticky, or too hard to roll, place the mixing bowl containing all the dough in the fridge for 10 minutes.) You want the balls of dough to be the size shown in the photo. If they are larger than that, remove some of the dough and re-roll. Place the balls of dough into an ungreased mini muffin pan. </p>
               <p> Place the mini muffin pan into the oven for 8 minutes at 375º Fahrenheit. You do not want to cook them any longer than this as you want them to be soft enough to be able to easily press the peanut butter cups into the cookie. They might not look like they are done, but they are. </p>
                Step 10

               <p> This is what the peanut butter cookies look like right out of the oven. </p>
                Step 11

               <p> Remove the Miniature Reese's Peanut Butter Cups from the freezer and quickly press them into the center of the cookies until the top of the peanut butter cups are even with the tops of the cookies. If possible, have someone help you so that you can get done faster. This will reduce the amount of chocolate that melts. </p>
                <p>Step 12
                Immediately place the mini muffin pan into the freezer on a flat shelf with a trivet or hot pad between the hot pan and the plastic shelf. Allow the pan to sit for 5-10 minutes or until the peanut butter cups harden. You can check to see if they are ready by gently shaking the pan and looking to see if the tops of the peanut butter cups jiggle at all. When the chocolate no longer jiggles, remove the pan from the freezer. </p>
                <p>Step 13
                Once the chocolate has set, remove the mini muffin pan from the freezer. Wash your hands. To remove the cookies, gently apply pressure along the top rim of each cookie and rotate the cookie from side to side. This will loosen the cookie from the pan. If the cookie has a bit of a ridge that extends beyond the muffin pan you should be able to easily pop it out of the pan. If the cookie is flush with the pan or below it, use the point of a steak knife to pry them out. They should come out very easily if you were able to rotate them. Repeat until all the peanut butter cup cookies have been removed from the mini muffin tin.  </p>

               <p> Repeat the last 5 steps with the remaining dough to bake the rest of the Reese's peanut butter cup cookies.  </p>

                                <p> Thin Mints - Homemade Girl Scout Cookies </p>
                                
               <p> INGREDIENTS:</p>
               <p>  1 cup unsalted butter, softened</p>
                <p>  1 cup powdered sugar, sifted</p>
               <p>   1 tsp vanilla extract</p>
               <p>  1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
               <p>  3/4 tsp salt</p>
              <p>   1 1/2 cups flour, sifted</p>
                <p>   1 lb bitter or semi-sweet chocolate chips</p>
               <p>   1 tsp, or to tastepeppermint extract</p>
<br>
                <p>Step 1
                Cream the butter until light and fluffy, then add sugar and beat together. Next, stir in the vanilla extract, salt and cocoa powder.</p>
               <p> Step 2
                Add in the flour and mix until the dough is crumbly. Then put the dough onto a clean surface and knead it until you can form a smooth ball. Next, divide the dough in half, flatten each half into discs, wrap in plastic and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes.</p>
               <p> Step 3
                Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and take one of the discs of dough out of the fridge. Dust a flat working surface with flour and roll the dough disc out. Cut out your cookies using your cookie cutter of choice and bake for about 10 minutes. </p>

              <p>  While your cookies are cooling, melt the chocolate over a double boiler / bain marie. Stir the chocolate until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain. Then stir in the peppermint extract and remove from the heat. I found that my chocolate was a little too thick to coat the thin mint cookies properly so if that happens to you too, you can put it back on the heat really quick and add 1 tbsp shortening.</p>
               <p> Step 4 
                Drop the cookies in one at a time and cover with a thin coating of chocolate. Tap whatever utensil you're using to dip with against your bowl to let the excess chocolate drip off. Allow your thin mint cookies to dry on a lined baking sheet. If you want the chocolate to harden faster, just stick them in the fridge for 10 minutes.</p>
               <p> step 5
