            	<h2>Gameplay</h2><br><p>

The ultimate predator's many things: methodical, determined, and unrelenting. Meet Rengar Rengar, the Pridestalker, one of the most-feared hunters in all of Valoran, whether he's slashing his way through foes or leaping from the shadows of the brush to take enemies by surprise. Rengar's monstrous, most-sought Head of KhaZix prize, however, remains at large, missing from the Pridestalker's impressive trophy wall.<br>
<br>
As a top-laner or jungler, Rengar's brutal Savager strikes and Battle Roar roars tear through his enemies. When you use any of his abilities on an enemy, you generate a point of Ferocity. Once you've stored five Ferocity points, Rengar's skills become available instantly and the next skill activated gains a powerful new secondary effect. Players will have to strategically manage their Ferocity, activating the appropriate ability for each precarious situation. Rengar's Unseen Predator passive also grants his auto attack a leap when used from the brush or while invisible, giving this apex predator immense ganking potential from hiding.
<br><br>
Rengar's ultimate ability, Thrill of the Hunt, grants him invisibility, extra movement speed and Ferocity points. The true power behind Rengar's  ultimate is his visibility of enemies under the fog of war. Rengar enters an all-consuming hunting mode, allowing him to see enemy locations and their hearts beating faster and louder as he closes in.
<br><br>
No hunter would be whole without his trophies and Rengar is no stranger to collecting the prized remains of his downed prey. Playing as Rengar grants optional access to the Bonetooth Necklace, a unique store item that collects trophies as he racks up kills and assists. Slaying enemies will increase the power of the  necklace and new bonuses unlock when trophy thresholds are met. You're never forced to purchase or use the Bonetooth Necklace item Bonetooth Necklace, but are rewarded for an aggressive playstyle if you choose to use it.

<h2>Tricks</h2>
<h3>Ability Usage</h3><br>
Unseen Predator allows you to gank unexpectedly. Use Thrill of the Hunt in order to not be seen across the map as you move towards your gank or save it for chasing if you think the target can escape with Flash and/or stealth or dash ability.<br><br>
Be careful with this as opponents will know if they are revealed.<br><br>
Unseen Predator allows Rengar Rengar to lunge to his enemies while stealthed using his ultimate. Use this to your advantage and use Thrill of the Hunt combined with  Savagery for an exceptionally well executed combo in rapid succession, then slow the enemy using your Bola Strike.<br><br>
Rengar Rengar can hop over walls using  Unseen Predator. Place a ward next to a jungle camp and get inside a brush over the wall, then simply attack the monsters. However, make sure they're inside your circle. Also, when your Bonetooth Necklace reaches 9 Trophies, use the extra range on your passive to make this wall-hopping easier.<br><br>
This is a great tactic for stealing epic monsters when counter-jungling or killing the enemy jungler.<br><br>
Maxing  Savagery first gives you a little bit of single targeted damage and burst.<br><br>
Rengar Rengar is a great jungler as his  Empowered Battle Roar heals him for a flat amount of his health. This allows him for excellent survivability both in lanes and jungles.<br><br>
When jungling alternate between  Empowered Battle Roar and  Empowered Savagery.<br><br>
The sustain of  Empowered Savagery with a  Vampiric Scepter is better than  Empowered Battle Roar if you can do full damage with the stacked attack speed. Use this to your advantage to get faster clear times, and get life back.<br><br>
Maxing  Battle Roar first gives you a good burst of AoE damage and a high defense boost for a few seconds. Consider it over maxing Savagery, when jungling or playing defensively.<br><br>
Use Empowered Bola Strike in order to stop enemies from running away.<br><br>
 Thrill of the Hunt is a decent tool for escaping ganks and other nasty situations. However consider that the stealth can be delayed to up to 3 seconds when attacked and enemies will know when you are within 1450 range of them.<br><br>
Rengar Rengar can use his ultimate in order to see invisible champions, such as Shaco Shaco, Twitch Twitch, Evelynn Evelynn, or another Rengar Rengar.<br><br>
When you cast Thrill of the Hunt Rengar Rengar does not immediately turn invisible but after about a 1-second delay. So keep this in mind while you are in battle.<br><br>
 Thrill of the Hunt allows Rengar to scout as it reveals enemy champions in a huge radius. This can allow his team to catch enemy champions hiding in bushes, or to prevent an ambush by the enemy hiding in bushes. This can also prevent enemy champions juking you or your allies using the fog of war or bushes.<br><br>
When ganking a warded lane, use Thrill of the Hunt outside of the ward's range.<br><br>
Item/skill usage ends  Thrill of the Hunt, but with the half second delay Rengar Rengar can still leap. This is useful to finish off almost dead champions with  Ravenous Hydra or  Blade of the Ruined King and then leap to another target.<br><br>
Using  Thrill of the Hunt with 5 Ferocity charges can lead to an overwhelming burst of damage, as he can leave stealth with an empowered skill, use his 3 non-empowered skills in quick succession on his target and then already use another empowered skill because of the Ferocity gain after leaving stealth.<br><br>
Rengar can cast  Bola Strike and  Empowered Bola Strike when he's leaping mid-air with  Unseen Predator. Therefore, casting  Thrill of the Hunt first, leaping on an enemy champion with  Unseen Predator then using Empowered Bola Strike mid-air almost guarantees a snare, then following  Bola Strike for further slow. It is extremely effective when ganking and is very easy for your teammates to deal more damage for a kill.<br><br>
Jungle Rengar Rengar is one of the best CC bursters allowing the player to Double Snare:<br><br>
With 4-5 stacks of Ferocity, engage the enemy with Thrill of the Hunt.<br><br>
Use either  Empowered Savagery for burst damage or  Empowered Bola Strike for superior CC lockdown during or shortly after leaping.<br><br>
Then, use abilities to reach 5 Ferocity stacks again in which time you can Bola Strike to slow them for a ton, or use Savagery for further damage.<br><br>
Once 5 Ferocity stacks have been reached again (should be about 2-4 seconds to regain 5 stacks) use  Empowered Bola Strike to Snare them again, or  Empowered Savagery for more damage.<br><br>
After level 6 it should be OK to take 1-3 turret hits when ganking a lane to secure a kill.<br><br>
This combo is an effective lockdown tactic, which most champions would find escaping difficult (unless you miss the skillshots). This double  Empowered Bola Strike snare combo is mostly inescapable unless they have two or more flash/dash abilities.<br><br>
Make sure your lane partner(s) is there to deal the damage or alternatively you deal the damage while they focus CC abilities.<br><br>
