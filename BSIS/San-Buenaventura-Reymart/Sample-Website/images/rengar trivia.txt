Trivia
Development
Rengar was designed by Classick.[1]
Rengar is voiced by Jason Simpson.
Rengar is an anagram for ranger.
Rengar's hairstyle, wrist blades, passive, and ultimate are references to the Predator franchise.
The visual effects designer for Rengar's log-in screen was Anthony Possobon.
General
As part of the event The Hunt Is On!, Rengar Rengar and Kha&#039;Zix Kha'Zix are assigned to defeat one another in battle. The first to score a kill on the other claims victory (assists count). The event begins randomly after Kha&#039;Zix Kha'Zix has used all 3 evolution points, Rengar Rengar is in possession of the Bonetooth Necklace item.png Bonetooth Necklace with at least 10 stacks, and all members of both teams must be alive for the event to start.

If Kha&#039;Zix Kha'Zix is victorious, he gains a fourth evolution point.
If Rengar Rengar is victorious, his Bonetooth Necklace item.png Bonetooth Necklace is replaced with the Head of Kha&#039;Zix item.png Head of Kha'Zix, which grants him the bonuses of a fully stacked Bonetooth Necklace item.png Bonetooth Necklace and gains Rengar increased vision range while in a brush.
This event can only occur once per game, even if both teams possess both champions. A video describing the event can be found here.

Rengar also shares many resemblances to the one-eyed leonin warrior Planeswalker, Ajani Goldmane, from the Magic: The Gathering trading card game.
Rengar also resemble the Imakandi from Samurai Jack, being anthropomorphic white lions with tribal culture and an obsession with the hunt and worthy prey.
Rengar's dance is a reference to the New Zealand tribal dance, Maori haka, particularly the Ka Mate. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here.
Rengar is one of ten champions to reference another champion in-game, the others being ZedSquare.png Zed,RenektonSquare.png Renekton, VolibearSquare.png Volibear, GravesSquare.png Graves, KhaZixSquare.png Kha'Zix,AatroxSquare.png Aatrox, QuinnSquare.png Quinn, ViSquare.png Vi, and JinxSquare.png Jinx.
Rengar's passive, Unseen Predator.png Unseen Predator, is similar to NidaleeSquare.png Nidalee's passive, Prowl.png Prowl, in that they both provide utility while in the brush. Caitlyn Caitlyn's Headshot.png Headshot is also an ability that uses the brush specifically in activation.
While RengarSquare.png Rengar is using Thrill of the Hunt.png Thrill of the Hunt nearby enemy champions will get an Exclamation point which was made famous by the Metal Gear Solid series.

Skins
