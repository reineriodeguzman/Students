<p class="paragraph">		One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン Hepburn: Wanpanman?) is an ongoing Japanese webcomic created by an author using the pseudonym One, which began publication in early 2009. The series quickly went viral, surpassing 7.9 million hits in June 2012. The Japanese shortened name Wanpanman is a play on the long-running children's character Anpanman, wanpan being a contraction of wanpanchi ("one punch").
A digital manga remake of the series, illustrated by Yusuke Murata, began publication on Shueisha's Young Jump Web Comics website in 2012. Viz Media has licensed the remake for English serialization in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine. A television anime adaptation by Madhouse aired in Japan between October and December 2015.
The story takes place in the fictional Japanese metropolis of City Z. The world is full of strange monsters that mysteriously appear and cause disasters. Saitama, the protagonist of the series, is the strongest hero, who easily defeats the monsters or other villains with a single punch. However, due to his immeasurable strength, Saitama has become bored with his power and is constantly trying to find stronger opponents who can present a challenge to him.
As Saitama is active as a hero, he meets various other heroes and villains. He gets a disciple, the cyborg Genos, and consequently joins the Heroes Association in order to gain official recognition. Despite defeating many strong monsters that even the Heroes Association’s top members are unable to defeat, Saitama struggles to gain respect. Most people look down on him due to his plain physical appearance, and some accuse him of being a counterfeit hero. Only a small number of individuals in the series recognize his talent and humility towards others.
