					-Now this is seriously dangerous.<br>
				Tasting the solid ground, he realized that he fell on his face.
				Power leaves his body, and already he can't feel his hands.
				However, the heat emanating in his abdomen was so unbearable, he wanted nothing more than to scratch at his own throat.<br>
				-Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.<br>
				The moment he opened his mouth in an attempt to scream, all that came out was his blood.
				Coughing, his life spills out of his throat. Gurgling, his mouth starts frothing as he vomits blood. With his hazy vision, he sees the ground stained red.<br>
				-Ah, this whole thing, is my blood.<br>
				His collapsed body is soaked with his own blood. About 8% of the human body consists of blood and it's argued that losing a third of that is life threatening-soon that will be all gone.
				As he draws his last coughs of blood, the heat still burns in his body. He musters strength to move his hand towards his abdomen in order to convince himself whether he can feel anything anymore.<br>
				-What, my stomach is ripped apart.
				No wonder it feels hot. <br>The pain and heat seem like illusions.
				A sharp laceration nearly splits his body in two, only kept together by the single thread of skin at his waist.<br>
				In the end, life's checkmate confronts him.<br>
				He is aware his consciousness is rapidly fading away.<br>
				The heat that caused him so much agony is gone, along with his sense of touch of his hand feeling the unpleasant blood flooding from his internal organs, and his consciousness is escorted to oblivion.<br>
				What is left behind is a rejected body unaccompanied by a soul.
				Before his consciousness fades, he puts one last effort in moving his body. He turns his neck facing up.<br>
				Before his eyes, he sees the floor carpeted with blood, and creates a ripple by stomping with his black shoe.<br>
				He has somebody. And that somebody probably has been killed herself.
				He wonders why he couldn't recall that face of hers.
				Even if he can't remember whether he stayed to spectate, he stopped caring about who that girl was.<br>
				He hoped though-was that she was safe, and thats' all he hoped.<br>
				(-bal?)<br>
				He felt that he heard a voice that sounded like a bell.
				But because he is in a state where he can’t even properly locate his ears or nose, the possibility of mishearing is really high.
				However, even if it was reproduced from his memories, the voice jolts him with cruel yet pleasant emotions.<br>
				So-<br>
				(-tsu!)<br>
				Short screams break out, and the carpet of blood welcomes someone new.
				Someone dramatically collapses by his side and clumsily stretched out her arm.<br>
				A fair white hand reached weakly to grasp his bloody hand.
				All this was probably a coincidence.
				Faintly moving his fingertips, he returned the grasp of his hand.
				...here.<br>
				He seizes his consciousness, taking back time through force.
				The pain and heat felt distant, it was useless to waste his breathe.
				But, still-
				(I, without fail-)<br>
				Will save you.<br>
				<strong>That next moment, he-Natsuki Subaru, died.</strong>
